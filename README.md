# YanuX Auth
This is the authentication and authorization server of the [__YanuX Framework__](https://yanux-framework.github.io/). It implements an [__OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server__](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6749.txt) with [__PKCE__](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7636.txt) (Proof Key for Code Exchange) support. 

A __Resource Server__ was also implemented to expose a service to check the validity of an access token as well as a standard [__OpenID Connect__](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) endpoint.
